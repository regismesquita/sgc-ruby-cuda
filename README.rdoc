== Welcome to SGC-Ruby-CUDA

SGC-Ruby-CUDA implements Ruby bindings to Nvidia CUDA SDK. It provides easy
access to CUDA-enabled GPU from a Ruby program.

SGC-Ruby-CUDA is incomplete in many ways. Currently, it supports only some
crucial CUDA Driver API functions. We aim to include the supports for most CUDA
Driver API and CUDA Runtime API functions.

SGC-Ruby-CUDA is tested on 64bit Fedora 13. We have not tested it against
32bit Linux OS and Windows. We certainly wish to improve the code base to
support multiple platforms in the future.

See devel.rdoc for the latest development plan.

== Design philosophy

The Ruby bindings, Ruby CUDA API, which deal directly with Nvidia CUDA SDK C/C++
bindings retain the CUDA Driver and Runtime API in a systematic way whenever
possible. This facilitates developers familiar with CUDA C who should be able to
use SGC-Ruby-CUDA with minimum effort.

Ruby classes and methods to ease the use of the API or making CUDA the
Ruby way would be built on top of the Ruby CUDA API.


== Prerequisites

* Ruby         (Tested with Ruby 1.9.2)
* CUDA Toolkit (Tested with CUDA Toolkit 3.1)
* C++ compiler (Tested with GCC 4.5.1)


== How to get SGC-Ruby-CUDA

The SGC-Ruby-CUDA git repository can be found in the following:

    http://github.com/xman/sgc-ruby-cuda
    git://rubyforge.org/rubycuda.git

The master branch can be checked out with the following command:

    git clone git://github.com/xman/sgc-ruby-cuda.git sgc-ruby-cuda
    git clone git://rubyforge.org/rubycuda.git sgc-ruby-cuda

The devel* branches may be checked out for a peep on the latest development.
However, they are highly volatile and _rebase_ may be applied for cleaner
commits. The devel* branches serve as grace period before commits move into
mainstream or master branches which are considered stable commits. This would
minimize unnecessary fixing commits.
